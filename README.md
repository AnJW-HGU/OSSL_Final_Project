# Study WatchâŒš
Study Watch is _The Final Project_ for HGU OSSLab class.<br>
> I made it using [open source](https://myhappyman.tistory.com/21).

## What does this project do?
Study Watch is a stopwatch used for _**studying**_.<br>
* There is a _**basic stopwatch**_ with start, pause, and stop buttons, 
* _**the total amount of study time**_ is recorded.

## Information about each files in _www_ directory
* studyWatch.html
  > It is the _design_ of a web page.<br>
  > It used html, css, and javascript(jQuery).
* stopwatch.js
  > It is related to the _action_ of the button.<br>
  > It _calculates_ the hours, minutes, and seconds of the stopwatch and _passes_ them to html.
  >> - init()
  >> - setInterval(function(), 1000)
  >> - clearInterval(timer)
  >> - document.setElementById("").innerHTML

## Why is this project useful?
This stopwatch projrct, which measures study time, is made _**only with mobile applications**_ and does _**not support PC version.**_
Study YouTubers make their own PCs stopwatch and use it.<br>
So, I implemented a **stopwatch** based on a pretty design, and I was able to save **the total time**.<br>
This project is useful not only for me, but also for study YouTubers and **people who study with PCs**.
