# Study WatchâŒš
Study Watch is _The Final Project_ for HGU OSSLab class.<br>
> I made it using [open source](https://myhappyman.tistory.com/21).

## What does this project do?
Study Watch is a stopwatch used for _**studying**_.<br>
* There is a _**basic stopwatch**_ with start, pause, and stop buttons, 
* _**the total amount of study time**_ is recorded.
